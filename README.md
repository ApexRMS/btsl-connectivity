The latest versions of reports covering this work can be read in [English](https://quebio.ca/en/connectivity_report) and [French](https://quebio.ca/fr/rapport_connectivite).<br />

The folders in this repo are organized in reference to specific phases within the BTSL connectivity analysis:<br />
**phase2**: Conservation prioritization of natural habitats in the St. Lawrence Lowlands based on their importance for ecological connectivity<br />
**phase3**: Changing terrestrial habitat connectivity within the St. Lawrence Lowlands under scenarios of climate and landcover change<br />

Each primary folder is then organized using a similar **b01b02** and **b03** folder structure to distinguish the work done corresponding to each région naturelle within the basses-terres du Saint-Laurent ecoregion.
